## What we should do?

+ [x] We'll have to create a questionaire
+ [ ] We'll have to make an algorithm in R that aims to process its informations

We should contemplate the following items for all or most of the information from questionaire

+ [ ] Maximum and Minimum value
+ [ ] Average
+ [ ] Median
+ [ ] Standard Deviation
+ [ ] Variance
+ [ ] Variation coefficient
+ [ ] First and Third quartiles
+ [ ] Calculate difference

At the end, we'll need to extract those information in charts and make a slide for presenting it on 16/07

## TODOs

+ [x] Gender
+ [x] Age
+ [x] Semester
+ [x] How much time uses internet
+ [x] How long have been using computer
+ [ ] Believe that internet disturbs the graduation
---
+ [x] Age x Internet using time (daily)
+ [x] Using internet for work x Semester
+ [x] Age x Consider social network a toxic environment
+ [ ] How much time uses internet x Which device uses
+ [ ] Age x Which device uses
