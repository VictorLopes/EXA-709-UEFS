- The algorithms should be written in R language

## What we should do?

+ [x] We'll have to create a questionaire
+ [ ] WeÄºl have to make an algorithm in R that aims to process its informations

We should contemplate the following items for all or most of the information from questionaire

+ [ ] Maximum and Minimum value
+ [ ] Average
+ [ ] Median
+ [ ] Standard Deviation
+ [ ] Variance
+ [ ] Variation coefficient
+ [ ] First and Third quartiles

At the end, we'll need to extract those information in charts and make a slide for presenting it on 16/07
